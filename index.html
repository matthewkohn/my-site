        <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
        <p>I've had a love for technology and renewable energy since childhood. I believe it the inevitable next step in providing power to our civilization. To further my knowledge, in 2018 I earned a certification in PV (photovoltaic) installation. I am interested in maximizing efficiency of solar energy production through the power of programming.</p>
